# Unnamed

An open-source programming language to empower everyone to build clean-cut, efficient, powerful, and reliable software.

Contributing guide and full language features coming soon. Stay tuned!

## Core

First, let's write a simple _"Hello World"_ program with Unnamed:

```py
print => "Hello World"
```

The `print` keyword is the standard to write items to the console/terminal throughout the entire language. This, however, is not the only option.

Due to the focus on modularity and ease of use in Unnamed, you can also use other keywords that point to the same action, called `alternatives`, as such:

```
say => "Hello World"
```
