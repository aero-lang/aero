# Aero

An open-source programming language to empower everyone to build clean-cut, efficient, powerful, and reliable software.

## Usage

First, let's write a simple _"Hello World"_ program with Aero.

```py
print "Hello World"
```

Due to the focus on modularity and ease of use in Aero, you can also use other keywords that point to the same action, called `alternatives`, as such:

```aero
say "Hello World"
```
